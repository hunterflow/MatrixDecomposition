# Numerical Methods Algorithms
## Description
### This repository contains MATLAB functions created in a Numerical Methods course at Colorado State University.
## Algorithms
### Matrix Decomposition
##### Factorizes an inputted matrix into an upper and lower matrix using partial pivoting.
### Summation
##### Uses a combination of Simpson's 1/3 and the trapezoidal rules to evaluate the integral of inputted tabulated data. 
### Root Finding
##### Uses the false position technique to determine the bounded root of an inputted function to a desired percentage of accuracy.

#### Repository created May 2019
